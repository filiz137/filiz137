        <!-- Hello, I'm Filiz Altinturk Front-End Developer in Istanbul.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have been working 8 years in digital agencies and cooperate company's.

        <br>
        <br>
        Hello!
        I'm Paulo Nunes, an independent front–end web developer based in Lisbon–Portugal.


        Full name's Rafael but everyone calls me Raf. I'm a front-end developer born & raised in Belgium, but currently working in London at NEVERBLAND.

       Fluent in HTML5 CSS3 Sass Less and improving on my JavaScript jQuery every day. I know my way around WordPress and I've recently started experimenting with REST APIs using Backbone and other MVCs.

       I have been working for 5 years in digital agencies as interactive art director and front-end developer. I work on institutionnal, showcase and media websites, as well as web and mobile apps.

       I learnt design during my earliest experiences with Julien Milliès and at Rezo Zero. I find inspiration in every kind of designs or compositions, to create creative and unique projects. Concerned about details (on Google Chrome), I like thinking about the animations, interactions, supported by front-end development and UX design skills.

       I like improving my workflows and testing new tools. I work in a clean environment using Sketch for design and Gulp/Git for development.

       To finish, I like taking part of meaningful projects offering help, information or at least an enjoyable experience for the users.


        Self-taught, passionate and creative builder of internet things, typography enthusiast & sometimes designer. Specializing in front-end development, with intermediate knowledge of back-end technologies.

        Helping individuals, teams and businesses build modern websites and web applications for over six years. Currently available for freelance work & collaborations, consulting, or a full-time position at your company.

        I have the experience and knowledge that your company is searching for and I have attached my resume with a comprehensive look at my work history, experience, education and training. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Physical Science and I have spent seven years working with front-end development.

        I am proficient using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. I used before SVN, TFS, Git for version control systems. I have the ability to design and develop high quality codes and then test these codes to make sure they work correctly. I also have the experience and training needed to follow and match all specification and coding standards.

        W3C standards, SEO and capabilities of different web browsers are factors I always keep in mind while designing and developing web content and my referees can speak for my excellent coding standards. If any problem is found during testing, I can find a suitable solution to solve the issue in a fast and efficient manner to keep the project on track. I possess excellent writing skills and the knowledge to keep detailed records of the work being performed.

        I am self-motivated so I can work alone but I also have great interpersonal skills that make it easy to work with a team both inside and outside the company.

        I am also productive and focussed working independently. You can see some of my work on my personal projects on my website at filizaltinturk.com.


        I’m a 23 years old web designer from France. I’m building apps and websites as designer / front-end developer.

        I spent 3 years learning web technologies and design, got my Bachelor degree in Communication and Multimedia Design and started working independently. Now, I’m a freelance web designer since 2012 and a member of IRIS Interactive team since january 2014. Most of the time I design and code responsive website based on wordpress, I’m getting really good at that (and pretty fast too).

        Freelancing have been a great way to explore new technologies. I also met a lot of interesting people and learned new skills like Craft CMS, AngularJS… You can read my curriculum for my pro stuff or my journal for the other adventure. All of my projects feature a unique individual style, original concepts and high quality.

        Every night keep a close eye on design trends and new plugins. Always keen on new challenges, I really try my best to make thing better and simpler. UI is my first love but I also envoy traveling and hiking. As a person, I’m doing my upmost to eat well, exercise and save the planet. I enjoy simple things of life and minimalism is my motto.

        I am looking for a new job opportunity. I have been itching for an environment change for a few months; something that challenges and inspires a bit more than my current office gig. Also planning on a big adventure for 2016. If you can help me in my quest or you have a project you would like to get me involved, feel free to get in touch.

        Cheers, -->
